TABIBI PROJECT - FINAL SOLUTION

You have encountered a common npm dependency conflict.
This is COMPLETELY NORMAL and easily fixed.

THE PROBLEM:
============
npm error: "ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree"

THE SOLUTION (Choose one):
===========================

OPTION 1: WINDOWS (RECOMMENDED)
================================
1. Open PowerShell in your project folder
2. Copy and paste this command:

   rm -r node_modules -Force
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   npm run dev

3. Wait for "Local: http://localhost:3000"
4. Open browser to http://localhost:3000


OPTION 2: MAC / LINUX
======================
1. Open Terminal in project folder
2. Copy and paste this command:

   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   npm run dev

3. Open http://localhost:3000


OPTION 3: If BOTH fail
=======================
   npm cache clean --force
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install --force
   npm run dev


WHAT THIS DOES:
================
- Removes old node_modules folder
- Installs fresh packages with compatible versions
- Allows npm to resolve dependency conflicts
- Starts the development server


EXPECTED OUTPUT:
=================
When running npm run dev, you should see:

  ➜ Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜ press h to show help

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser!


TROUBLESHOOTING:
=================
1. Port already in use?
   - The server will use port 3001 instead
   - Or close whatever is using port 3000

2. Still getting errors?
   - Check INSTALLATION_FIX.txt for more details
   - Check KNOWN_ISSUES.md for common problems

3. Need help?
   - Read README.md
   - Check BUILD_FIXES.md
   - Read KNOWN_ISSUES.md


YOU'RE GOOD TO GO! 🎉
Start the server and test the app!
