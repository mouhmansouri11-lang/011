WINDOWS USER - SIMPLE STEPS:

1. Open PowerShell in your project folder
   (Right-click → Open PowerShell here)

2. Copy and paste this EXACT command:
   
   rmdir /s /q node_modules
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps

3. Wait for it to finish (5-10 minutes)

4. Then run:
   
   npm run dev

5. Open browser and go to:
   
   http://localhost:3000

DONE! Your app is running! 🎉

---

If "rmdir /s /q node_modules" doesn't work:
Try this instead:
   
   npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
   npm run dev

---

If npm install is too slow:
You can try using yarn or pnpm instead (but npm works fine)

---

THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO DO!
